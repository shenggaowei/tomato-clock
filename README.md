## Introduction to the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a simple and effective time management method. Using the Pomodoro Technique, choose a task to complete, set the Pomodoro timer to 25 minutes, and focus on working. Do not allow any interruptions related to the task during this time until the Pomodoro timer rings. Then, take a short break (5 minutes is enough), and start the next Pomodoro. After every 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break. The Pomodoro Technique greatly enhances work efficiency and provides an unexpected sense of accomplishment.
